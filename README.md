# GANS-FYP-
## 🚀 Sprint 1 – DAG v0.1 (Oct 6 – Oct 19 2025)

**Objectives**
- Implement Foolbox integration for PGD attacks  
- Develop digital patch generation pipeline  
- Build basic image preprocessing with OpenCV  

**Deliverables**
- DAG v0.1 with working preprocessing + patch pipeline  
- PGD adversarial demo verified on CIFAR-10/Tiny-ImageNet  
- Test coverage for patch module (PyTest)  

**Result**
✅ Successfully generated adversarial examples  
✅ Foolbox PGD altered model predictions  
✅ All core scripts operational (`preprocess.py`, `patch_pipeline.py`, `run_pgd.py`)
